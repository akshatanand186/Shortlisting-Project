For writing the code part, C++ has been used throughout.

Storing The Student details
Student details:-

A struct named student is created which has various fields such as name, category, class10percentage.. etc 
We store all the details entered in the csv file into a vector of vectors which initially stores 
everything as string. Now the string is converted into a double using stod function
in C++ for fields such as percentage, CG, marks etc.

The code comprises of 3 part:-

1. Read_CSV function - reads input file and stores the details.

This function takes the given csv file after modifications as explained in file I/O methods
as input and processes it to store each student's details. The data structure we used 
for this is Vector of vectors. We then pass the details for each candidate into
the struct student. Then this struct is passed into the isStudentEligible function.

2. isStudentEligible function - Uses decision tree and if else statements to shortlist.

This is the logic part of the code which has been explained in the decision tree.
Two values will be returned, one will be a bool value, which indicates whether student is selected or not
Other will be a string, which mentions the reason of qualification/disqualification.

3. write_csv function - Printing The Output

This is a simple function which creates another output csv file to display the result returned
by the isStudentEligible function.
