-Reading Input from Excel file into C++ Program

First we look on how data is stored in a spreadsheet. The CSV(comma separated values) file is a comma separated file that
uses comma to separate values. Each record(row) consists of one or more fields(column), separated by commas.

To read input from CSV file into C++ program, we have used the getline function in C++ which reads out the entire line and
stores it as a string. To read a field, we use the getline function again but now the delimitter is a comma. This ensures a field 
is read until we encounter a comma and stores it in the string.

The end of the file is marked with a '$' symbol which has been entered manually in the excel sheet.

Shortcomings of the above:- 

1. Dealing with NON BREAKING SPACE
The input file provided may have non breaking space in it which creates problem while reading the file.
To remove this the best method is to use excel formula for all cells = TRIM(SUBSTITUE(X,CHAR(160),""); which
replaces the non breaking space with null character and makes the file readable.

2. Disadvantage of using "," in getline as delimitter

If the input CSV file already has "," in it, we are not able to distinguish between the commas, so to 
deal with this we replace all the commas in the excel sheet with space or null character. 
This method is advantageous over other methods only when we know the commas in the input does not have any significance.
In case when commas will have it's role we will have to use other methods.
